## Project tasks

**1 - Frontend:** Replace image gallery component with the following component : https://github.com/ChristophAnastasiades/Lingallery. See "instructions/1.png" for details.

**2 - Backend:** Create a separate project in your local machine (nodejs preferable) with an API endpoint that stores and retrieves from a database the views for the current day for the current itemID (TEST-P15-0000A-A9). This value needs to be displayed on the page as well. See "instructions/2.png" for details.

### Extras:
- The scrolling on Activity list is now part of page scroll.
- Removed white background from primary buttons so that they don't overlap with activity content.

## Project submission

Please send us the new source code for both the website and your local API project in a zip file or another github/bitbucket repository.
